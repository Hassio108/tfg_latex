# LaTeX template for "Trabajo fin de grado" at ETSIINF / UPM

## Code

You can use `minted` package in order to hightlight your code. This package uses
`Pygments`, a Python library, so you have to install Python if you don't have it.

There is an example in this template, and you can explore all its options in the
[documentation.](http://osl.ugr.es/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/minted/minted.pdf)

If you want all the available languages, just type in your shell ```$ pygmentize -L lexers```
